<blockquote><b>Vision:</b> We are in an era of computer science as a fundamental academic skill.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Mission:</b>Strengthening our ability to perform in STEM aubjects using the art of computer science.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Challenge: Technology is advancing at such a rate that traditional ways of teaching and learning are not pushing students and teachers to their full potential.</blockquote>

According to the Nation’s Report Card, the National Center of Education Statistics (NCES) administered a 2022 NAEP (National Assessment of Educational Progress) Long Term Trend (LTT) reading and mathematics assessment for 9 year-olds. The purpose was to compare student growth from pre-Covid 2020 events and post-Covid effects of transient instruction (face-to-face to virtual or hybrid). Results show a 5-point decrease in reading and 7-point decrease in mathematics compare to scores in 2020, markedly the largest decline in average scores since 1990 and first time ever that mathematics scores declined (NAEP, 2024). 


The LTT reading and mathematics differ from the main NAEP assessment. The first LTT assessment was administered in the early 1970’s using age criteria. The LTT is limited to iterative curriculum changes and are paper-based. The main NAEP assessment used grade criteria, underwent periodic curriculum changes and is digitally-based. Due to numerous variables that may be associated to the decline in scores (teacher equity, educational resources, school or district policy and practices) there is no causation between pre-Covid and post-Covid experiences or effects.


Previous NAEP reports show that 21 percent of 4th grade mathematics teachers and 18 percent of 8th grade mathematics teachers in the nation who had students to take the NAEP assessment reported a lack of adequate resources were a moderate or serious problems within their schools.  Adversely, seventy (70) percent of the nine year olds had technology resources during the 2020-2021, which was the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, many schools have not caught up to the demands of technology. During COVID-19, such over-utilization of technology during the pandemic mandated students and parents to assimilate virtual teaching and learning, coupled by the abruptness for teachers to synthesize academic content with conventional pedagogy into an instructional module for learning management systems. Our takeaway is a digital instruction database aligned to standardized test performance. Effects of conventional pedagogy as a digital repository is changing how students learn, and the education paradigm shift is leaning towards tactile or kinesthetic learning, that is, where hands and bodies are utilized more so than ever, yet we cannot escape the virtual learning environment. 


Basic and minimal instruction afforded to every student should not be the model of technology applications, with access to repositories and AI (artificial intelligence) productivity tasks. Utilizing learning management systems or repositories coupled with AI is an automation of technology applications. Restemblance believes in the era of technology problem solving, not technology applications.


For instance, the Maker spaces or Maker technologies is a movement has pushed for STE(A)M curriculum, where arts and creativity blend with science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  There is a high demand for schools to implement Maker curriculum to meet the demands of the 21st century workforce. According to the U.S. Department of Education, there will be a 17 percent increase in STEM jobs. Teachers in independent schools are the founders of cutting-edge pedagogy and curriculum to put this plan into action. Restemblance seeks to join this movement with reconstructing STE(A)M curriculum advised by STEM career professionals, artists and educators to develop products and resources that serves as the ‘voice’ of students and how they want to learn. Project-based learning is an example of hands-on curriculum defined by Scientific American as, “ a method of instruction that focuses on discovery through extended inquiry and open-ended student-driven projects.”  Restemblance markets artwork to emphasize hands-on learning through its logo, “I’m a hands-on learner”™️, to advocate student-led instruction, using project-based learning intertwined with STEM content that connect to student learning styles. 


The derivative of the Maker movement is the design thinking process, where career goals, snips of citizen science and review of current literature can develop a prototype that can provide an efficient or effective STEM education solution.  


From K-12 through higher education, school districts and university leaders are utilizing technology beyond file storage, document sharing, course management and exam testing. Education institutions are enhancing the hands-on experience using state-of-the-art tools, such as 3D technology. Restemblance embraces this active movement of hands-on experiences and project-based learning by developing technology problem solving curriculum that can be implemented to K-12 teachers and students.  Developing hands-on, STEM content addresses the dilemma that “now technology is advancing at such a rate that traditional ways of teaching and learning are not pushing students and teachers to their full potential.” Traditional teaching with an active learning component, or hands-on learning experiences can serve students’ multiple intelligences or varied learning styles. 


Restemblance develops data literacy activities to engage learners in STEM content. Data literacy is building and developing data models that reflect a thorough understanding of real-world applications in math and science.
